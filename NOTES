We tried:
	Ethernet, Wifi+AP, Wifi+AdHoc
combined with:
	TCP,UDP provided by NetCat.

Ethernet+anything worked well
Wifi+AP+TCP worked, but had long lags
Wifi+AP+UDP worked better, but with packet loss
Wifi+AdHoc+TCP worked well, but had lags
Wifi+AdHoc+UDP worked well, packet loss at longer-ranges
